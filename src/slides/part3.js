        <Highlight>We started using React Native in 2016</Highlight>, and we've
        shipped <Highlight>numerous apps to the App Store</Highlight> over the
        past 2 years.

        It was only after jumping in that we fully realized the power in this
        framework.

        We had <Highlight>2 main observations</Highlight>:
      </NotesText>
      <NotesText small>
        The developer experience was{' '}
        <Highlight>extremely similar to writing React on the web</Highlight>.
        With this, our entire team essentially became mobile developers, which
        is a HUGE deal. <Highlight>In the past</Highlight> we've only had a
        couple of developers who had any mobile experience, so their plates were
        always full with every mobile project we had lined up, but now we can{' '}
        <Highlight>literally have any developer on our team</Highlight>{' '}
        contribute to our mobile projects (and they have!).
      </NotesText>
      <NotesText small>
        * This is a pretty <Highlight>big deal</Highlight>. New developers
        coming in only have <Highlight>one basic framework</Highlight> that
        needs to be learned for <Highlight>front-end development</Highlight> and
        then they can immediately start working on web and mobile applications!
      </NotesText>
      <NotesText small>
        The apps we built just <Highlight>“felt” a lot more native</Highlight>{' '}
        than previous cross-platform frameworks. This is something that really
        just needs to be in your hands to get the full effect.{' '}
        <Highlight>
          And actually, you most likely have interacted with React Native on
          your mobile device and didn't even realize it.
