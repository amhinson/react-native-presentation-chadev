        When React came out it was revolutionary in how it changed front-end

        When people realized that the same underlying framework could be used

          We've still got a long way to go before that dream is fully realized,

        With the possibilities of using the core functionality of React & React
        Native in all of these places and the fact that a lot of large companies
        are investing into the technology, we felt like it was a wise decision
        to jump in, and we haven't looked back since.
